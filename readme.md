Explain why the result of ('b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a').toLowerCase() is banana.
Answer: 
Simpler equivalent ('b' + 'a' + (parseInt('a')) + 'a');
+'a' or parseInt('a') results to NaN because 'a' cannot be converted to a number.
('b' + 'a' + (parseInt('a')) + 'a').toLowerCase() => baNaNa.toLowerCase() => banana
